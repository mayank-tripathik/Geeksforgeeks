/*
 * Given an array, how to check if the given array represents a Binary Max-Heap.
 * Examples:

  Input:  arr[] = {90, 15, 10, 7, 12, 2} 
  Output: True
  The given array represents below tree
         90
       /    \
     15      10
    /  \     /
   7    12  2 
  The tree follows max-heap property as every
  node is greater than all of its descendants.

  Input:  arr[] = {9, 15, 10, 7, 12, 11} 
  Output: False
  The given array represents below tree
         9
       /    \
     15      10
    /  \     /
   7    12  11
  The tree doesn't follows max-heap property 9 is 
  smaller than 15 and 10, and 10 is smaller than 11. 
 * Max-heap has property that every node is greater than all of its descendants.
 * A Simple Solution is to first check root, if itâ€™s greater than all of its descendants. 
 * Then check for children of root. Time complexity of this solution is O(n^2)
 * An Efficient Solution is to compare root only with its children (not all descendants), if root is greater than its children 
 * and same is true for for all nodes, then tree is max-heap 
 * This conclusion is based on transitive property of > operator, i.e., if x > y and y > z, then x > z.
 * Similary we can check for min heap property by changing the compare operator
 * Complexity : O(n)
