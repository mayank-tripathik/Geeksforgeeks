/*
 * Given weights and values of n items, put these items in a knapsack of capacity W to get the maximum total value in knapsack. 
 * You cannot break an item, either pick the complete item, or donâ€™t pick it (0-1 property).
 * Given an item 'n', with value v1 and weight w1, we basically have only two choices: 
      1. To include the item in the knapsack 
      2. To exclude the item from the knapsack. 
 * At each item 'n', we compute the value that could be obtained in both include and exclude cases and choose the case which 
 * gives more value. If we choose to include the item 'n', then we decrease the weight limit by w1 and then compute the maximum 
 * possible benefit using items from 'n+1' onwards(benefit_n_Plus). 
 * This maximum possible benefit(benefit_n_Plus) + (benefit of including item 'n') is maximum benefit obtained in the include 
 * case for item n. Now in the exclude case, weight limit is not modified and maximum possible benefit is computed from item 
 * 'n+1' onwards. This computed benefit is the maximum possible benefit for item 'n' in exclude case. 
 * We compare the benefits obtained in include and exclude case and return the maximum of these two values.  
 * To compute maximum possible benefits from item 'n+1' onwards, recursive calls are made with modified weight limit in the 
 * include case. Base case for the recursion would be when all the items are considered or when the weight limit remaining is 0. 
 * In both of these cases, benefit returned is 0.
 * If we draw recursion tree fro above approach ,many states in recursion tree are repeated and hence redundant computations 
 * are performed. TC of this approach is exponential. O(2^n). (Because we have 2 choices at every stage)
 * Since suproblems are evaluated again, this problem has Overlapping Subprolems property. 
 * So the 0-1 Knapsack problem has both properties of a dynamic programming problem. Like other typical Dynamic Programming(DP) 
 * problems, recomputations of same subproblems can be avoided by constructing a temporary array in bottom up manner or top down
 * manner. Following is bottom up aprroach in Dynamic Programming based implementation.
