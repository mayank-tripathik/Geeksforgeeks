/*
 * Given K sorted linked lists of size N each, merge them and print the sorted output.
* Example:
  Input: k = 3, n =  4
  list1 = 1->3->5->7->NULL
  list2 = 2->4->6->8->NULL
  list3 = 0->9->10->11
  Output: 
  0->1->2->3->4->5->6->7->8->9->10->11
 * A Simple Solution is to initialize result as first list. Now traverse all lists starting from second list. 
 * Insert every node of currently traversed list into result in a sorted way. Time complexity of this solution is O(N2) 
 * where N is total number of nodes, i.e., N = kn.
 * Another sol: Create new array of size n*k and sort it using merge sort. TC: O(nk Lognk)
 * A Better solution is to use Min Heap based solution which is discussed here for arrays. Time complexity of this 
 * solution would be O(nk Log k)
 * Following program is the implementation divide and Conquer approach. This approach doesnâ€™t require extra space for 
 * heap and works in O(nk Log k)
 * We already know that merging of two linked lists can be done in O(n) time and O(1) space (For arrays O(n) space is required). 
 * The idea is to pair up K lists and merge each pair in linear time using O(1) space. After first cycle, K/2 lists are left 
 * each of size 2*N. After second cycle, K/4 lists are left each of size 4*N and so on. We repeat the procedure until we have 
 * only one list left. 
 * TC :Time Complexity of above algorithm is O(nk logk) as outer while loop in function mergeKLists() runs log k times and 
 * every time we are processing nk elements.
